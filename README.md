# Camouflage Image

This project was developed in the discipline of Fundamentals of Image Processing.

The goal is to implement a basic version of the algorithm show in the paper [Camouflage Images](http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niloy/research/camouflage/camouflage_images_sig_10.html) presented at SIGGRAPH.

## Setup

Python 2.7.*

`make setup` to install the dependencies.

## Run

`make run` will execute the algorithm.
